# angular-emscripten

This repository shows how to integrate emscripten wasm-modules inside an angular 21 application. The modules are compiled with emscripten version 3.1.74 under Windows 11. There .bat files which I have used for compiling the examples. For building libfreeimge.a have a look at https://github.com/pohldaniel/FreeImage_emscripten and run compile.bat and link.bat. Some useful repositories I have visited as well https://github.com/cwoffenden/hello-webgpu, https://github.com/boyanio/angular-wasm and https://github.com/eliemichel/LearnWebGPU-Code/tree/main.
